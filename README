This is the linux port of Gautier's 3d engine.  Most things
work more or less... sometimes less.
This is NOT the DOS version, and does NOT work with DOS.
Yes, I know there is a DOS subdirectory!  It will work
with DOS someday, but not today!

You will need:
(1) An Ada compiler.  I use the GNAT compiler available from
    ftp://cs.nyu.edu/pub/gnat
(2) Linux!  I use Debian GNU/Linux.
(3) The linux svga library svgalib.  If you can't find it, check
out http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~zivav/svgalib/ or
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/lib/graphics

In what follows I will assume you are using the GNAT compiler.
You can make the demos by running the script compile.linux
in the demos subdirectory.  Run the program "demos" and there
you are!

You may have to run this program as root.  This is because
the svgalib directly accesses the screen, and the average
humble user doesn't have the required access permissions.

Note that the file names have been krunched to 8 character
DOS style names.  Either use gnatchop to turn these into
files with long names, or use the -gnatk8 option when
compiling.  The compile.linux script uses -gnatk8.

Wish list:
(1) Mouse support that works!
(1) Support for non-us keyboards
(3) <add your wishes here>

Good luck!
